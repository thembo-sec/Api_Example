# Lazy(?) REST APIs

This repo contains the source code to go along with my proposed pycon AU 2024 talk.

Each step is in the `/src` folder under `/src/example1_<details>.py`. `/src/apisession.py` contains an abstract example.

This is largely done using the Virus Total v3 api as the example as its convenient and fits with working in cybersecurity.
