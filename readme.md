# Lazy(?) REST APIs

This repo contains the source code to go along with my proposed pycon AU 2024 talk. Is it easier? Probably not. Did it require less work than normal implementations? Also probably not. Does it make the code more readable and portable though? Absolutely not.

Each step is in the `/src` folder under `/src/example1_<details>.py`. `/src/apisession.py` contains an abstract example.

This is largely done using the Virus Total v3 api as the example as its convenient and fits with working in cybersecurity.
